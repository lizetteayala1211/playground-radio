						Dinner With Us Series - In the summer of 2019 Playground launched “Dinner With Us”, a community dinner series. 
						<br><br>
						We introduced the initiative through a three course meal (made by materials and produce donated by local food organizations, farms and CSAs) while highlighting the detrimental food climate that exists in Bed-Stuy. 
						<br><br>
						The access to healthy and sufficient food sources are limited in our community.  Our intention is to start a conversation and introduce practices in food security and solution based thinking. 
						<br><br>
						For this iteration we will shift our focus to see how we produce high levels of food waste when the people in our community are food insecure. Our mission is to provide insight about food waste at a consumer and community level.
